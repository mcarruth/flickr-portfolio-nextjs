## 📖 How to Use Your Portfolio

### For You (Managing Content)

**Adding Photos:**
- Upload to Flickr and tag with `portfolio`
- Photos appear instantly (no rebuild needed)

**Organizing:**
- Use tags to categorize photos (travel, portraits, landscapes, etc.)
- Configure album tags to create curated categories (see Advanced Configuration)
- Add geotags for photos to appear on the map

**Removing Photos:**
- Remove the `portfolio` tag on Flickr
- Photo disappears from your site automatically

### For Your Visitors (Viewing)

- **Home** - Full-screen slideshow of your portfolio
- **Albums** - Browse photos by curated categories (if configured)
- **Tags** - Explore by tag (landscape, portrait, etc.)
- **Map** - See where photos were taken (for geotagged images)

**Navigation:**
- Arrow keys or swipe to move between photos
- Click navigation arrows on desktop
- Press `E` to toggle EXIF overlay with camera settings
- Press `ESC` to close overlays or go back

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Your Own Domain

**On Vercel:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click **"Domains"**
3. Add your custom domain (like `photos.yourname.com`)
4. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed

**On Netlify/Railway:** Similar process in their domain settings

### Changing the Look

The portfolio has a dark, cinematic aesthetic by default. To customize:

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Edit files in the `app/` and `components/` folders
3. Push changes to GitHub
4. Your hosting platform will auto-deploy updates

(Requires some basic coding knowledge - or ask a developer friend!)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### My photos aren't showing up

- ✅ Make sure photos are **public** on Flickr (not private)
- ✅ Check they're tagged with **"portfolio"** (all lowercase)
- ✅ Verify your User ID is correct
- ✅ Wait a minute and refresh (it fetches from Flickr's API)

### The map is empty

- ✅ Make sure photos have location data on Flickr
- ✅ Check that geotagged photos also have the "portfolio" tag
- ✅ Privacy note: The app only shows city-level location, not exact GPS

### Deployment failed

- ✅ Double-check environment variables are set correctly
- ✅ Make sure you copied the entire API key (no spaces)
- ✅ Try redeploying after fixing variables

### Getting API errors

- Free Flickr API allows 3,600 requests/hour - plenty for a portfolio
- If you hit limits, wait an hour and try again
- Check the browser console (F12) for specific error messages

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Leaflet** - Interactive maps
- **Flickr API** - Content backend

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flickr-portfolio-nextjs.git
cd flickr-portfolio-nextjs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Add your Flickr credentials to .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

```

### API Integration

Uses these Flickr API methods:
- `flickr.photos.search` - Find portfolio photos by tag
- `flickr.photos.getInfo` - Get photo metadata and tags
- `flickr.photos.getExif` - Get camera settings and technical details

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Album Tags (Optional)

The Albums page uses a **tag-based album system** for organizing your portfolio into curated categories. By default, the Albums feature is **disabled** (nav link hidden) until you configure it.

**Benefits:**
- One photo can appear in multiple "albums"
- Accurate photo counts (only portfolio-tagged photos)
- No need to manually organize Flickr albums
- Automatic categorization based on your existing tags

**How to enable:**

Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALBUM_TAGS=landscapes,portraits,street,travel
```

Replace with your own category tags (comma-separated, no spaces).

**What happens:**
- **Albums nav link appears** in the navigation bar
- **Albums page** shows your curated categories as "albums"
- **Tags page** shows all OTHER tags (for browsing/discovery)
- Photos with multiple tags appear in multiple albums
- Leave empty to hide the Albums feature entirely

**Example workflow:**
1. Tag your best landscape photos: `portfolio`, `landscapes`
2. Tag your best portrait photos: `portfolio`, `portraits`
3. Tag a landscape that's also black & white: `portfolio`, `landscapes`, `bw`
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALBUM_TAGS=landscapes,portraits`
5. Result:
   - **Albums page**: Shows "Landscapes" and "Portraits" as albums
   - **Tags page**: Shows "bw" and other browsing tags
   - The B&W landscape appears in the Landscapes album

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Curate carefully** - Only tag your best work as "portfolio"
2. **Tag thoughtfully** - Tags become browsable categories (and optionally, albums)
3. **Add descriptions** - Flickr descriptions appear in the EXIF overlay
4. **Geotag when relevant** - Makes the map view more interesting
5. **Keep photos public** - Private photos won't appear
6. **High-quality images** - Upload your best resolution
